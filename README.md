# Projects
TAASK 1 - Restaurant Recommender System for Customers


Project Overview:
This project aims to elevate user satisfaction by suggesting restaurants aligned with their preferences. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques to build and assess the effectiveness of recommender systems. The outcomes help inform future decisions regarding the choice of techniques for recommender systems in restaurant suggestions.

Business Objectives:
Enhance User Experience: Improve user satisfaction by providing personalized restaurant recommendations.
Data-Driven Decisions: Utilize PCA and SVD to analyze user preferences and restaurant characteristics to make informed recommendations.
Performance Assessment: Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of PCA and SVD in developing recommender systems.
Inform Future Techniques: Determine the most effective techniques for future recommender system implementations based on empirical data.

Technical Objectives:
Data Import and Setup: Configure the necessary environment and import all relevant datasets.
Data Preparation: Clean the data by removing unnecessary fields, renaming columns, splitting certain columns, creating dummy values, merging datasets, filtering datasets to essential components, and optimizing memory usage.
Content-Based Recommender System: Implement separate recommender systems using PCA and SVD tailored to restaurant content.
Comparison of Recommender Systems: Analyze and compare the performance and results of PCA and SVD recommender systems.
Collaborative Recommender System: Develop a collaborative filtering system using PCA to enhance recommendation accuracy.

TASK 2 -Diving into Restaurant Reviews: What are Users Saying About Restaurants in Ohio
Project Overview
This project aims to dive deep into restaurant reviews in Ohio to understand customer preferences and perceptions. By employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyze textual data to identify trends in customer reviews, providing valuable insights into what diners enjoy or dislike about various restaurants. These insights are crucial for restaurants aiming to improve service quality and develop effective business strategies.

Business Objectives
Understanding Customer Preferences and Perceptions: Gain insights into customer sentiments and preferences by analyzing the textual content of restaurant reviews.
Identifying Trends: Analyze trends in 5-star and 1-star reviews to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various restaurants, aiding them in enhancing service quality.
Technical Objectives
Data Collection and Management: Efficiently import and manage data from external sources (CSV files) into a structured format suitable for analysis.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Apply NLP techniques to analyze textual data from restaurant reviews, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
Data Analysis and Visualization: Utilize data analysis techniques to extract meaningful patterns and trends from the reviews. Create visualizations such as word clouds and n-gram analyses to represent these findings visually.
Review Authentication: Demonstrate methods to compare false reviews by employing stemming and lemmatizing techniques.
