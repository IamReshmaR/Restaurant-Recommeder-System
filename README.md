Restaurant Recommender System for Customers


Project Overview:
This project aims to elevate user satisfaction by suggesting restaurants aligned with their preferences. We employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) techniques to build and assess the effectiveness of recommender systems. The outcomes help inform future decisions regarding the choice of techniques for recommender systems in restaurant suggestions.

Business Objectives:
Enhance User Experience: Improve user satisfaction by providing personalized restaurant recommendations.
Data-Driven Decisions: Utilize PCA and SVD to analyze user preferences and restaurant characteristics to make informed recommendations.
Performance Assessment: Evaluate and compare the effectiveness of PCA and SVD in developing recommender systems.
Inform Future Techniques: Determine the most effective techniques for future recommender system implementations based on empirical data.

Technical Objectives:
Data Import and Setup: Configure the necessary environment and import all relevant datasets.
Data Preparation: Clean the data by removing unnecessary fields, renaming columns, splitting certain columns, creating dummy values, merging datasets, filtering datasets to essential components, and optimizing memory usage.
Content-Based Recommender System: Implement separate recommender systems using PCA and SVD tailored to restaurant content.
Comparison of Recommender Systems: Analyze and compare the performance and results of PCA and SVD recommender systems.
Collaborative Recommender System: Develop a collaborative filtering system using PCA to enhance recommendation accuracy.
